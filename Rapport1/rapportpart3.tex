	\maketitle
	\thispagestyle{fancy}
	\section{Corrections}
	
	First of all, we tried to correct the mistakes during the second part of the project. We added a little descriptions at the beginning of each function, in order to precise what the class is supposed to do, where it is used, which classes it uses...
	
	\section{Modifications of the game}
	
	\paragraph{Handling the charts} 
	One of the required assignement was to make appear an information about the game in a chart. We decided to translate two things into charts: the money of the player and the evolution of the weight of the cargos in trains. We created two classes to deal with it : \textit{Charts} and \textit{SwitchCharts}. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Charts }: It extends \textit{LineChart}, its main goal is to draw the chart of the value and the derivation of it (in order to see the variations of the values), to update the charts, and to handle the bounds properly. There is also a method that can reinitialize the charts, it is used for weights' charts, because the graphs are not the same for different cargos.
		\item \textbf{SwitchChart} : It enables the player to choose between a graph and the derivation. It is actually the effective class we use for drawing the charts.
	\end{itemize} 
	\paragraph{Saving a game} 
	Wa also had to find a way to save a game. We created 4 classes and objects that enables us to do so: \textit{fileReader}, \textit{fileWriter}, \textit{saveLoader} and \textit{saveUtils}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{fileReader} read a file that hes been created, and \textit{fileWriter} allows the creation of a new file, which contains the information that matters about the game, like the destinations of the trains, the map or the populations of the cities when the player save the game.
		\item \textit{saveLoader} basically enables us to reload the game that was saved, by reading the corresponding file (using \textit{fileReader}).
		\item  \textit{saveUtils} is used for saving the game effectively, by writing all the relevant information into a file (via \textit{fileWriter})
	\end{itemize}
	If you want to save a game, first you have to launch one, then, when you want to quit, you must click on "Save" (which is in "Informations générales"). You will have to create a new file, and then save the game in it.
	As soon as you want to continue it, you have to launch a game, but you must choose "Charger une sauvegarde" and open the game you want.

	\paragraph{Additional feature: Cargo destinations}
	A train can now change its loading when it passes through the cities. Actually, the cargo are dispatched in different towns with the class \textit{CargoDispatcher}. 
	
	\section{Known bugs}
	
	\section{Additional features}
	\paragraph{Zooming in and out}
	Now, the player can zoom in a map with the mouse, and move it with "Q" for left, "D" for write,"Z" for up and "S" for down. We created a new class \textit{zoom} that we use in the class \textit{gui}. This class enable us to resize the map, according to what the player demands. The map is no longer "static" and is now adaptable, which is something you pointed us out.
